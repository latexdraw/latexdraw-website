    <description>This new version fixes many bugs, in particular for MacOSX.
One new feature is that an 'app' package is now provided for MacOSX users. They just have to put it in the "Applications" folder and it should be smoothly integrated in the system.
Java 8 is also required (instead of the old Java 7) to run the application.

    <description>This new version fixes major bugs.
Since the 3.3 version, you may have noticed performance issues (lags) while editing, moving. I just found a fix -- using openGL to render the graphics -- but it may rise glitches or other graphical issues depending on you system and on your graphical card. For instance the mini-toolbars are not painted correctly with my Intel graphical chipset on Linux. Nevermind, the graphical performances are great now. You can still de-activate the use of openGL in the preferences.

    <description>The no-more-far 3.3 release will bring an exciting new feature: the support of psplot! The command psplot permits to plot functions as depicted in the following figure. As you can see, you can type your function following the postscript formalism. You can also customise some parameters such as the number of plotted points, whether the function has to be plotted following polar coordinates, etc. I know there is a feature to type functions in a more natural way (e.g. sin(x) instead of x sin) but this is not supported yet. You can also import PSPlot code into LaTeXDraw. You can try that by using the latest development version</description>

    <description>I said in my previous post that ps2eps requires Perl. In fact, the real problem on Windows is that ps2eps does not exist anymore!? I just replaced the use of ps2eps by ps2epsi. It should normally fix the problem of exporting EPS picture. You can try that by using the latest development version: https://ci.inria.fr/malai/job/latexdraw/lastBuild/net.sf.latexdraw$latexdraw.core/. Tell me whether this issue is now fixed.</description>

    <title>Exporting as PS/PDF on Windows</title>

    <description>Miktex is certainly the widely-used LaTeX distribution on Windows. Some LaTeX binaries (pdfcrop and ps2eps notably) have a dependency to an application not installed by default by Miktex: perl. So, Windows users that do not have perl installed cannot use pdfcrop and ps2eps. They, therefore, may not be able to export as PDF/PS using LaTeXDraw. It seems that the only solution is to install perl: http://strawberryperl.com/.
To known whether pdfcrop and ps2eps work, you can check them by looking at the text in the tab "System" (menu "Help" -> "About LaTeXDraw").
I will look at avoiding such a new installation for the next release.</description>

    <description>This new version fixes major bugs. I did not have the time to finish the support of PSPlot functions. It will be part of the next release for sure.
Amongst the fixed bugs, the biggest one is certainly a bug related to the PDF/PS export on Windows 8.1.

    <description>This new version brings important changes and fixes major bugs. The new features are: Opacity and strokeopacity attributes are now supported. That permits to set the opacity of colours for the line border and the filling; The size of drawing area is no more limited to the size of the drawing. Additional boundaries are now provided around the drawing area to ease the editing; In complement to the previous change, a page (US letter only for the moment) is painted; When zooming using the mouse, the zoom process follows the pointer. The zoom increment, min, and max values have been changed to fit this new feature; Like many drawing applications, the view point of the drawing area can be move using the middle button of the mouse (or both the right and left buttons in some cases). It is more convenient than using the scroll bars; Better rendering performance; Ukrainian translation added; A menu item has been added to go to the latexdraw manual; A text field that contains the LaTeX compilation error log has been added to the text toolbar.
Regarding the fixed bugs, the major one is the non-creation of LaTeX text on Windows 7 and 8.

    <description>If the native LaTeX rendering works like a charm on Linux, it seems that it does not work correctly on Windows.
I just fixed an issue that blocked that feature on Windows Seven but I do not have a Windows 8 to test that.
So, do not hesitate to download the latest devolopment version (https://ci.inria.fr/malai/job/latexdraw/lastBuild/net.sf.latexdraw$latexdraw.core/) to test the LaTeX rendering on Windows (Seven, 8) and MacOSX, and send me an email or use the forum to give me feedback!</description>

    <description>Ok ok folks. Almost one year without any release... If you want to blame someone, blame Blizzard to have released Diablo III in April 2012 and my job ^^. More seriously this release re-introduces the conversion of pstricks code into shapes, and fixed several and annoying bugs such as the pdf-blank-page bug. Just as a reminder, this branch 3.0 is almost a complete rewriting of the application to ease the future developments. Thats' why it takes so long. The version 3.0 is almost feature complete. So the next release will be a beta one and will bring bug fixes, performance and usability improvements.</description>

This version: several Windows Seven bugs fixed; can customise grids and free hand shapes using widgets; can change the angles of arcs using their handlers; can reuse and create templates; the PSTricks parameter 'showpoints' supported for Bézier curves. Test it! One more alpha version is expected to (re-)support PSTricks import. Then, beta versions will be prepared to fix issues.</description>

    <description>Whooooooooooo! Finally a release. It's about time. Ok ok, this is not a stable release but a preview for testing purposes only. LaTeXDraw 3.0.0 alpha 1 has been released with a lot of improvements such a native support of LaTeX text, pdf export on Macos has been fixed, etc. You can get the files and the release note there: https://sourceforge.net/projects/latexdraw/files/beta%20testing/3.0.0%20alpha1/. There is still a lot of features not yet re-introduced in 3.0.0 (for your memory: LaTeXDraw has been completely rewritten for the 3.0.0 version), such as: it is not possible to rotate shapes yet; no PSTricks import; no recent files; some widgets are still missing for modifying some shapes' attributes; etc. You can report any problem there (https://launchpad.net/latexdraw) or there (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=156523). I will release a new alpha version at the end of February.</description>

    <description>More than one year without any release and post... Shame on me. LaTeXDraw 3.0 in on the road and a first beta should be released before the end of this year. This release takes a lot of time because I am completely rewritting LaTeXDraw: the code of 2.0 is really awful and I wanted to integrate the results of my PhD into LaTeXDraw in order to improve this last. The most important feature of LaTeXDraw 3.0 will be the native support of LaTeX text. It means that you will be able to write LaTeX text as in your favourite LaTeX editor. The text will be rendered in LaTeXDraw as in your final pdf or ps document. For example, in the following screen-shot I added a text in the drawing and typed a formula. Once typed, the text is compiled in LaTeX to be rendered in LaTeXDraw. This idea is strongly inspired by Lyx ;). Of course, if you want to use LaTeX commands coming from various packages, you can add \usepackage{} commands as it is already possible in LaTeXDraw 2.0. You can also discover in the screen-shots others new features; but I will speak about them in next posts soon.</description>

	  <description>This release fixes the issue that did not allow the export as pdf documents on Windows. By the way on Windows, to export as pdf using pdfcrop you need a perl interpreter installed such as strawberryperl (http://strawberryperl.com/). About the problem concerning a text that contains special characters (for instance the ampersand character), latexdraw will not escape these characters for two simple reasons: 1) a text shape in latexdraw must be formatted in latex since latexdraw is not an interface to latex as lyx. 2) If we escape special characters, how will we be able to use these special characters, for instance to create a tabular?</description>

	  <description>Finally! latexdraw 2.0.3 is just released and brings a great (in my opinion) feature: the ability to export a drawing as pdf and ps using your latex distribution. To sum up, a latex document, containing your drawing, is created and compiled into a pdf or a ps document. You can then insert it into your main latex document as a picture (pstricks packages are no more needed and the pdflatex command can be used).
This release also fixes some problems for more information) and the Italian localisation is now available!</description>

	  <description>If you speak Spanish, Italian, German, Japanese, and so on, you can help to translate latexdraw in your language. Such help can be a correction of a translated string or the translation of untranslated strings. The process is simple: to make translations you just need to create an account on launchpad and to set your language(s). Then you can translate latexdraw (and any program which is on lauchpad such as Ubuntu, Gnome,...). See https://translations.launchpad.net/latexdraw/. If you find that a translation is not correct, you can modify it too. </description>

	  <description>2.0 is now released, but certainly the most important release (for me) will be the 2.1. This future version will complete the work began in 2.0, such as the rewrite of the graphical library and of the undo/redo manager. Almost all of the original code has been rewritten in order the have a stout framework to easily implement more PSTricks and graphical stuffs. Because of that, the final user will see only minor changes. But after 2.1, 2.2 will return to provide PSTricks, LaTeX and graphical features such as maybe the pgf export, and some requested features.</description>

	  <description>The stable release of the 2.0 series is now release. It fixes some problem from the last beta version. Feel free to report any problem you find.
Look at the release note for more details. The more important things are certainly the use of the SVG format as the default format, the alignement and distribution of figures.</description>
